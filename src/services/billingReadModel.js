// What a dashboard is told about a client's billing.

// Everything here is derived at read time from the allocation — the same
// function the invoice is built from — so a client's screen and their bill can
// never disagree. Nothing in this file writes, and nothing reads a stored
// counter: a balance is what is left after replaying the interviews that have
// been run.
//
// The one thing that does not come from the allocation is billed history. That
// comes from the usage ledger, because it is the record of what was actually
// charged, at the price it was charged at, and it must not move afterwards.
//
// COST: one allocation per call, which walks the payer's used interviews. See
// the note at the top of interviewAllocation.js.
